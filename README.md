# Trello Clone

With this project I would like to strengthen and expand my React skills.
I pre-defined three steps with the functionalities I plan to achieve in each step.

## Step 1

Creating a basic layout and functionality with two components:

### `Column`

> Each collumn has a title.
> Cards can be added to it.

### `Card`

> Each Card has a title and a description.
> Cards can be deleted.


## Step 2

Add more advanced functionality:

### `Board`

> Option to add more columns.

### `Column`

> Columns can be deleted.


## Step 3

Drag&Drop:

### `Card`

> Drag&Drop to move card from one column to another


## Step 4

Make it more dynamic:

### `Column`

> Drag&Drop to change order

### `Card`

> Drag&Drop to change position within a column
